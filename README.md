[Final Project Assignment](docs/ece558w21_final_project_intro.pdf/)

## ECE 558 Final Project -- Propose, design, implement, and demonstrate a project of your choosing
## <b>This assignment is worth 100 points but there are up to 7 points of extra credit available for additional functionality.  Demo day is on Mon, 15-Mar from 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM via Zoom.  Deliverables are due to GitHub and D2L on Wed, 17-Mar by 10:00 PM. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS, PLEASE.  You will need to submit a written Progress report to D2L by 10:00 PM on Thu 11-Mar </b>

### <i> We will be using GitHub classroom for this assignment.  You should submit your assignment before the deadline by pushing your final Android Studio projects and other deliverables to your team's shared GitHub repository for the assignment. We'd also like you to archive your final submission repository as a .zip and upload it to your Final Project dropbox on D2L.  We realize that this may not work for all teams due to the upload file size limitation in D2L</i>

## After completing this assignment students should have:
- Proposed and executed a team-based final project involving the Android platform
- Completed a technical presentation and demonstration of the project
- Gained experience in participating in team-based project development and management for a "significant" project


### Summary

This final project is a chance to put what you learned this term into practice.  Each team will propose a final project which must be accepted by the instructor.  Once the project has been accepted the team will complete the design of the project, implement and debug it, and show it off to their classmates, the instructor and T/A and, perhaps, a few invited guests.  Your team project will be in a friendly competition with the other project teams, with the oft-coveted "Wall of Fame" award going to the best overall project (design, documentation, presentation, etc.).  There is no cash award to the Wall of Fame winners, no bling, no s.w.a.g. ["stuff we all get" according to the Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com)].  So why bother...bragging rights!  Impress your friends!  Impress your classmates!  Impress the hiring managers!

We will be using the Group Project support in GitHub classroom for this assignment.  This means that your team will share a private repository on GitHub that can also be accessed by the instructor, T/A, and Grader for the course. You will submit your work via that repository.  We will review your work and provide feedback based on what your final submission was.  The process for accepting this assignment is the same as that used for project #2. One of you will need to create a new group in both D2L and GitHub classroom and tell your partners what group to join.  As with Project #2 please join only your team;  joining another team either accidentally or deliberately could prevent the actual team member(s) to join.

Since some of you are taking both ECE 5558 and ECE 540 this term I am willing to consider combined final projects (one final project you can use for both ECE 540 and ECE 558). Please contact me before the proposal is due if you are interested in doing a combined project.  We will try to work out an acceptable concept giving all team members an equal chance to contribute to the final deliverables.

### Where to submit your deliverables for the project:
- Project Proposal:  Submit to your Final Project Proposal dropbox on D2L.  Include a .pdf of your approved proposal in your deliverables
- Progress Report:  Submit a written Progress Report to your Final Project Progress Report dropbox on D2L.  Include a .pdf of the progress report in your deliverables
- Video(s) of your demo. Include a narrated video (.mp4 or equiv) that demonstrates the functionality of your final project in your GitHub  deliverables
- Demo presentation slides - Include  a .pdf of your final project presentation in your GitHub submission.
- Design Report:  Include a .pdf of your final project design report in your GitHub submission
- Source code, etc.: Include your Android Studio project(s) and any other source code, transcripts, etc. in your GitHub submission.
- Final GitHub repository - to GitHub...obviously, but I'd also like you to upload a .zip file of your repository to your Final Project Deliverables dropbox on D2L.  Some of you will  not be able to do so because D2L places a size limit on uploads.  Still,  I'd appreciate it if you could give it a try.  It's not a big deal either way, but it just might make our grading more efficient.

## Grading Rubric:
- Written final project progress report – 5%
- Demo day presentation (all team members should present) - 20%
- Correctly implements committed functionality – 40%
- Quality of design report – 15%
