Contributors: Abhiraj Abhaykumar, Nikolay Nikolov, Ramprakash Baskar

Objective:
	The objective of the project is to develop a Intruder Alarm System using Android App, Raspberry Pi and Pimoroni Explorer hat. We were able to run face detection neural network algorithm in the raspberry pi and used Google Firebase Database to store the image detected by raspbery pi. Once face is detected a notification is sent to the Android App using Firebase Cloud Messaging. The user at the Android end will be able to view the images and then send commands using MQTT messaging protocol.
